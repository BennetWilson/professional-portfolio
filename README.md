  ## Description 
  
  This is my professional portfolio. I created it with HTML, CSS, JS and Semantic UI.

  This is my second iteration of this project.

  I wanted to create a clean and minimal design but still show off the skills that I have been learning.

  My LinkedIn, GitHub and Resume are linked in this application for any potential employers.
